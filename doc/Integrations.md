# Integrations

How do they work?

In STL, you decorate your test case functions with `failure`; in python, you do it with `@on_failure`, but internally, they work the same.

By now, you've seen the *terminal* integration. It is very simple â€” it just prints whatever error it happens to stdout.

**Pysellus** comes with three integrations by default: *terminal*, *slack* and *trello*, but you can make your own (See [defining custom integrations](.) - in progress).

---

#### Configuration

Most integrations will need some kind of parameters to work correctly, like API keys, or other.

Pysellus looks for this configuration data in a [YAML](http://yaml.org/) file, called `.ps_integrations.yml` by default, in the directory passed as an argument when starting the program.

This configuration file has a very simple structure: all the notifications that you want to use must be declared in a `notify` block, as shown below.

```yaml
notify:
    'user alias':
        integration_name:
            attr1: val1
            # ...
            attrn: valn
```

Here, we are defining an `integration_name` integration, with an alias of `user_alias`, and configuring it with `n` attributes and values. Your aliases must be unique across all declared integrations.

#### [Slack][slack-url]

The [Slack][slack-url] integration makes use of the [incoming webhooks api](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks), and needs only a post URL. To get one, you have to set up your own incoming webhook.

Additionally, you can pass a channel to your integration, and it will notify that channel.

To define an instance of a `slack` integration, with an alias of `foo`, we would write:

```yaml
notify:
    'foo':
        slack:
            url: 'https://...' # slack post url
            # optionally, one of
            channel: '#some_channel'
            # or
            channel: '@some_user'
```

Obviously, you can give it whatever name you want.

#### [Trello][trello-url]

The [Trello][trello-url] integration notifies you in your [Trello][trello-url] board of choice.

It uses [Trello][trello-url]'s official [API](http://developers.trello.com/), so you will need to generate an [application key](https://trello.com/app-key) for your **Pysellus** instance as well as an [authentication token](http://developers.trello.com/authorize) with write permissions.

It supports two modes of notification:

##### By card

Sends all notifications into a single card, appending them as items of the checklist which you specify.

You configure it like this:

```yaml
notify:
    'my-trello-alias':
        trello:
            key: 'your-application-key'
            token: 'your-authorization-token'
            card: 'the-id-of-your-card'
            checklist: 'the-id-of-your-checklist'
```


##### By list

Sends all notifications into a single list, creating one new card per notified item.

You configure it like this:

```yaml
notify:
    'my-trello-alias':
        trello:
            key: 'your-application-key'
            token: 'your-authorization-token'
            list: 'the-id-of-your-list'
```
